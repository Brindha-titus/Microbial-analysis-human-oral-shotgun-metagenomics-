This project implements an end-to-end saliva shotgun metagenomics analysis pipeline for comparing healthy and periodontitis samples. Raw paired-end FASTQ files are first quality filtered and host (human) reads are removed using KneadData (Trimmomatic + Bowtie2). Cleaned reads are taxonomically classified with Kraken2 to generate species-level abundance profiles. Kraken reports are parsed in R to construct a taxa × samples count matrix, followed by prevalence and abundance filtering. Community structure is assessed using alpha diversity (Shannon, Simpson) and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity with PCoA), and statistical group differences are tested using PERMANOVA and dispersion analysis. Differential abundance is evaluated using ALDEx2 (compositionally aware) and MaAsLin3 (multivariable modeling). Finally, a panel-based oral dysbiosis index is computed using curated beneficial and pathogenic taxa to provide per-sample interpretability. All outputs are exported as structured tables and publication-ready visualizations.
